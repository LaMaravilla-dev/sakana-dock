## Title

Enhancing Compositional Generalization in Neural Networks via Compositional Regularization

## Short Hypothesis

Introducing a compositional regularization term during training can encourage neural networks to develop compositional representations, thereby improving their ability to generalize to novel combinations of known components.

## Related Work

Previous work has highlighted the challenges neural networks face in achieving compositional generalization. Studies such as 'Compositional Generalization through Abstract Representations in Human and Artificial Neural Networks' (Ito et al., NeurIPS 2022) have explored abstract representations to tackle this issue. However, limited research focuses on directly incorporating explicit regularization terms into the training objective to enforce compositional structures. Our proposal distinguishes itself by introducing a novel regularization approach that penalizes deviations from predefined compositional patterns during training, encouraging the network to internalize compositional rules.

## Abstract

Neural networks excel in many tasks but often struggle with compositional generalizationâ€”the ability to understand and generate novel combinations of familiar components. This limitation hampers their performance on tasks requiring systematic generalization beyond the training data. In this proposal, we introduce a novel training method that incorporates an explicit compositional regularization term into the loss function of neural networks. This regularization term is designed to encourage the formation of compositional representations by penalizing the network when its internal representations deviate from expected compositional structures. We hypothesize that this approach will enhance the network's ability to generalize to unseen combinations, mimicking human-like compositional reasoning. We will test our method on synthetic benchmarks like the SCAN and COGS datasets, which are specifically designed to evaluate compositional generalization, as well as on real-world tasks such as machine translation and semantic parsing. By comparing our method to baseline models and existing approaches, we aim to demonstrate significant improvements in generalization performance. This work offers a new avenue for enforcing compositionality in neural networks through regularization, potentially bridging the gap between neural network capabilities and human cognitive flexibility.

## Experiments

- Implement the compositional regularization term and integrate it into the loss function of standard sequence-to-sequence neural network architectures with attention mechanisms.
- Train models on synthetic datasets like SCAN and COGS, evaluating performance on compositional generalization tasks with and without the regularization term.
- Apply the method to real-world tasks such as machine translation using the IWSLT dataset and semantic parsing with the GeoQuery dataset, assessing improvements in generalization to new language constructs.
- Analyze the learned representations by visualizing embedding spaces and utilizing compositionality metrics to assess how the regularization affects internal representations.
- Conduct ablation studies to determine the impact of different strengths of the regularization term, identifying the optimal balance between enforcing compositionality and maintaining overall performance.
- Compare the proposed method against other approaches aimed at improving compositional generalization, such as meta-learning techniques and specialized architectures.

## Risk Factors And Limitations

- The effectiveness of the compositional regularization may vary across different datasets and tasks, potentially limiting its generalizability.
- An improperly balanced regularization term could negatively impact model performance on the primary task, leading to lower accuracy.
- Additional computational overhead from calculating the regularization term may increase training time and resource requirements.
- Defining appropriate compositional structures for complex or less-understood domains may be challenging, affecting the applicability of the method.
- The approach may face scalability issues when applied to very large models or datasets common in industrial applications.
